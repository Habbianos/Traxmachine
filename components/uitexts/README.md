# Traxmachine UI Texts

These Traxmachine UI texts have been recovered from the WayBackMachine, using the URL `/gamedata/external?id=external_texts` in various old Habbo domains. The recovery process involved searching through historical snapshots, such as [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20091013230115/http://www.habbohotel.com.br/gamedata/external?id=external_texts).

## File Format

The files are in the same format with each line representing "key=value." These texts were originally part of the user interface in the Traxmachine feature of Habbo.

## Missing Texts in `au.txt`

It's important to note that the `au.txt` file may contain missing texts. In such cases, the recommended fallback is to use the international texts provided in the `us.txt` file.

## Usage

To incorporate these Traxmachine UI texts into your project, consider the following steps:

1. Download the relevant text files, ensuring to handle missing texts as per the instructions.
2. Integrate the text files into your application, utilizing the "key" to retrieve the corresponding "value" for display.

Feel free to explore and adapt these texts to suit the UI requirements of your application.
